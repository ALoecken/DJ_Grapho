These are python scripts that I played around with but did not use or fix anymore.
- playlister.py was the first version of this project. It directly uses a graph instead of caching everything in a DB. 
- 'youtube_downloader_noAPI.py' should download mp3s from Youtube. However, I played around with it a bit but stopped working on it as I and am rather sure that using it is a violation of Youtube's terms of service and maybe copyright laws.
